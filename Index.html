  <h2>Make planning travel part of your next adventure.</h2>
  <p>The goal of this project was create an app that delivers a fun, inviting and relaxing experience that gets users excited about their trip rather than stressed out about the details. The main focus is group travel, but the app can equally be utilized for the individual.<br><br>

  <h3>1. Research</h3>
  <p>After conducting 5 interviews, I gathered key artifacts from my notes and synthesized the data with an affinity map to continue defining the user.<br><br>
    Once I had identified clear pain points, wants, and needs, I was ready to create the user persona.<br><br>
    To dive deeper into the persona, I created an Empathy Map in order to decipher the user's inner thoughts/feelings, or something they wouldn't say in an interview.<br>

  <div class="col">Planning group travel is disorganized, complicated and stressful. There are too many individual sites to keep track of. Plans/itineraries/ideas get lost in email threads and in busy, disorganized chats. Split payment is spotty and difficult to keep track of. There is no one single place to plan and collaborate with groups.</div>

  <h3>3. Ideation - Sketching/Mid-Fi</h3>
  <p>With the problem statement secured, I began the ideation phase with an open brainstorming session.<br>
    I filtered my findings with a matrix to prioritize features that provided specific and attainable solutions for the user's pain points.
    Only after refining the data and creating a user flow did I begin sketching the prototype.

      + A sleek, resort-style app that transports the user in the experience.<br>
      + Personalization options - Profile, Trip Pages, etc.<br>
      + Group collaboration & Split payment options<br>
      + Trip memories page that allow groups to share and store trip photos without the worry of social media privacy controls

      Once the features were outlined, I drafted a user flow to anchor my design and limit the scope.

  <h3>4. Testing and Final Iteration</h3>
  <p>From sketches to mid-fidelity and testing, I iterated my design based on user feedback throughout the process.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">USER TESTING</h5>
      With the mid-fidelity prototype, I completed 4 user tests. In order to get quicker results, I utilized guerrilla testing. (Above: A guerrilla testâ€”conducted at none other than a Starbucks!<br><br>
      What I gathered:<br>
      - The sidebar icons functionality were not understood<br>
      
      - The icons needed to be changed to a hamburger menu<br>
      
      - Icon/task bar on Trip Page was well-received<br>
      
      - Sign-up process was quick and easy<br>

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">FINAL ITERATION / GOAL</h5><br>
      Wanderlust provides a more viable option than products within the current market by eliminating the need for an overwhelming amount of sites and tools. With trip board collaboration, organization is natural rather than forced. By promoting a fun and easy to use travel planning experience with travel-themed aesthetics, users can be excited about planning rather than treating it as a chore. The goal is to allow users to start their adventures when they begin planning, rather than when their plane lands.
